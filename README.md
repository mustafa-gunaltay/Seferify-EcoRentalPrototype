# Eco-Friendly Shared Car Rental Demo

This project focuses on creating an environmentally friendly car rental platform. By leveraging electric vehicles and shared transportation options, it aims to address common urban transportation challenges while promoting sustainability.

## Purpose and Problem Definition

The application aims to solve several transportation issues, including:  
- High vehicle and taxi costs.  
- Distrust in taxis and second-hand vehicles.  
- Discomfort in public transport.  
- Environmental damage caused by internal combustion engines.  

By utilizing electric vehicles, the project promotes eco-friendly transportation solutions.

## Features

1. **Vehicle Search and Reservation:**  
   Users can filter vehicles based on their needs, check availability, and proceed with reservations after identity verification.

2. **Payment System:**  
   Multiple payment options are supported, and users receive details of the vehicle pick-up location and time after payment confirmation.  

3. **Sustainability:**  
   The system exclusively supports electric vehicles to minimize environmental impact.  

4. **User-Friendly Design:**  
   The application features a clean and intuitive interface, including a dark mode option for enhanced usability.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET  



## How It Works

1. The user selects a vehicle based on specific filters.    
2. The user provides identification details (name, age, and driving license).  
3. If eligible, the reservation is confirmed, and payment is processed.  
4. The user receives pick-up location and time details.  

If the user does not show up, 50% of the payment is refunded, and the vehicle is returned to the available list.


## Focus on Sustainability

This project highlights the importance of reducing carbon emissions through the adoption of electric vehicles, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.
